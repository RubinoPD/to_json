CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:6 (find_package):
  By not providing "Find/usr/local/include/json.hpp.cmake" in
  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package
  configuration file provided by "/usr/local/include/json.hpp", but CMake did
  not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "/usr/local/include/json.hpp" with any of the following names:

    /usr/local/include/json.hppConfig.cmake
    /usr/local/include/json.hpp-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "/usr/local/include/json.hpp" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "/usr/local/include/json.hpp_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "/usr/local/include/json.hpp"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
